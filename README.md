# About

This is a simple project we'll be working through on a workshop, and then iterating changes into through ongoing assignments. It will be a very basic support ticketing system.

## Commit One - Fundamentals of HTML

Going from bare files to actually seeing something in the browser.

* What does HTML need.
  * Doctype
  * head
    * title
    * meta viewport and charset tags<sup>[1](#f1)</sup>
  * body
* Why is this important? (The browser does work without it, but you suffer from a lot of 'undefined behaviour' quirks.)

## Commit Two - Lightspeed introduction to nodejs

Workshop covers a few topics here whilst getting the worlds simplest server up and running:

 * Why is a webserver important?
 * Why nodejs
 * What is npm
 * Basic anatomy of a shell command (binary, arguments, switches)
 * The basics of ports, DNS and request routing (using hosts file, port 80, port 3000)
 * Can students access a site on my laptop? (They can on my home wifi, may depend on the hotel router policies.)
 * Why running a local server is the bad news.

We run these commands:

    npm install --save express minimist;
    node server.js;
    node server.js -p4000;
    sudo node server.js -p80;

## Commit Three - HTML markup

We look at how to plan your markup tags and structure and what to consider as you do so.

 * Start with a pen.
 * Planning markup
   * Consider screenreaders.
   * Consider progressive enhancement (though not in this app!)
   * Consider economic discrepencies
   * Consider semantics
   * Consider SEO
 * Making it happen.
   * Consistency in markup / code layout (developer ergonomics)
   * Tabs vs spaces, why you're wrong. And why it doesn't matter. But also does. As does everything else.
   * Input types and what they improve / break (tel / email etc)
   * What is a placeholder and why everyone is an idiot.


## Commit 4 - Styling the markup with CSS

We now look at prettifying up the HTML structure using the wizadry of CSS.

 * Planning your styling
   * Consider color blindness / partial sight
   * Consider "Trust in design" and the Aesthetic-Usability Effect. Design = important.
   * Counter to this, consider performance. Fast = important.
   * Balance these. I dare you.
   * Other common affordances - abbreviation / explicitness. Consider audience.
 * Making it happen - implementing a design
   * CSS formatting, source control and Cmd/Ctrl-F.
   * Browsers - Ugh. Use a reset. (Eric Meyer / HTML5 BP) Even better - use HTML5 BP or similar.
   * Why id's are the devil and element-based styles are worse. (Unless they're not.)
   * Grids - they're pretty good. (But we won't use one)
    * padding wrappers vs box-sizing: border-box
    * The necessary evil of negative margins.
   * BEM / OOCSS
   * Page title - em sizing vs px
   * Form styling
     * box model
     * Block vs inline
   * Form title
     * Absolute / relative position
     * nudging stuff about in the inspector. It's not cheating, but it feels like it is.
   * List stylez
    * The DOM tree - and why I've avoided it until now. (Arms-race specificity. Code drift on large projects)


## Commit 5 - Making this dynamic with Javascript

  * Goal: capture form requests, store locally.
  * Where to look for help
    * Stack overflow
    * MDN
    * Me.
  * Welcome back to npm - let's use jquery (The ONE concession to the MS syllabus!)
  * discuss the bits copied from HTML5 BP - inc SRI on jquery CDN. (Why CDN at all?) (https://www.srihash.org/)
  * (alert something and link in JS)
  * Why not async?
  * jQuery vs DOMMethods - CSS selectors / bind events.
  * Basics of events
  * anon functions vs named functions. (debugging / readability)
  * HTML5 validation and browser fallbacks (we're not doing them here).
  * Variable hoisting
  * FormData and why we're not using it.
  * Subtle differences, jquery / ES6 (each / forEach key, value transposition)

## Commit 6 - Further adventures of javascript - writing to the DOM

In which we return information back to the DOM and briefly discuss the prinicples of scoping and separation of concerns. This is not terribly important now, but will become so in our next sessions, when testing becomes a topic.

  * Break up into modules - discuss the basics of scoping and global vs local variables.
  * Convert ticket to tickets
  * Pull tickets from localstorage and display them.
  * Discuss edge cases (no tickets?)
  * Using jquery to write to the DOM - discuss proper escaping and XSS.
    * First - demonstrate the vulnerable version:
    <pre>
      listItems = existingTickets.map(function(ticketDetails) {
          var str = itemTemplate;
          str = str.replace('{{ name }}', ticketDetails.name);
          str = str.replace('{{ summary }}', ticketDetails.details);
          str = str.replace('{{ date }}', ticketDetails.date);

          return str;
      });
      $list.html($(listItems.join('')));
    </pre>
    * Then the fixed version: `str = str.replace('{{ name }}', $('<p></p>').text(ticketDetails.name).html());`
    * Then just use a template library. (Also discuss whitespace etc.)


## Commit 7 - Letting the user know

We're rendering HTML / CSS now and reading and writing from the DOM into JS, but we're not doing it very well. If you were a user of our app you'd be doing a lot of refreshing, and did I didn't I? with regards button presses etc. So, let's start handling the _user_ as well as the data.

  * Display results on submit
  * Clear form on submit
  * What about data quality / attacks / corruption?


## Commit 8 - Adding a feature

Currently our app shovels all the data in the sidebar, what happens when a ticket is too lengthy? We need to plan and build a solution to the long-ticket problem.

  * Demonstrate the 'bug'
  * Discuss the bug
  * Fixes:
    * Display truncated description (measure a string in the console for truncation length.)
    * display a popover on click (Build and style the popup first, then do the JS)
    * rebuild the popover to display the correct ticket correctly


## Commit 9 - Responsive design

Need to make a few tweaks to make this design work responsively.

  * Break down the grid
  * Adjust the popover.
  * Discuss "out-there" designs, (fixed heights etc) in terms of document flow and why our design was so easy to make respnosive.


## Commit 10 - Delete a ticket

As tickets are completed, they should be removed.

  * Add some controls
  * Make those controls work


## Commit 11 - Refactoring

Even though we've got good, well planned, working code your code can almost always be improved. As apps grow, the complexity creeps up and complexity is the project-killer. It's worth taking a moment every now and then to look at the code more holistically, and see if it can be improved.

  * File structure.
  * Relative vs absolute assets
  * JS structure in relation to testing
    * Pull out ticket store into its own thing.
    * write some tests for ticket store (try / catch on JSON.parse and stringify, discuss contracts, standardise the ticket response)
    * discuss testing of list
    * move summarise(str) into ticket


## Footnotes

<sup name="f1" id="f1">1</sup> Not technically required by the html spec, as the others are, but very important in the same way.
